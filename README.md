A small mod that defaults your titan to guard mode when dropped. Has 2 ConVars for customization:

`default_guard_mode`:
- 0: Disables default guard mode. (Normal game behavior)
- 1: Always set titan to guard mode on drop. (Default)
- 2: Always set titan to guard mode on drop, only in LTS.

`default_guard_mode_once`:
- 0: Guard mode is set on every drop. (Default)
- 1: Guard mode is only set on the first drop of the match, similar to normal game behavior.
